# Incremental Transfer Learning (ITL) Survey

This is the code repository for our paper:

## A Survey of Incremental Transfer Learning: Combining Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning and Domain Incremental Learning for Multicenter Collaboration

This part investigates the efficacy of continual learning methods for classification tasks in multicenter collaboration. It is evaluated on two datasets: the Tiny ImageNet dataset and the retinal dataset.
For segmentation tasks, due to the massive changes of the framework including the network architecture, evaluation metrics, and training losses, we use a [separate repository](https://github.com/YixingHuang/ITLsurveySegmentation) for such segmentation tasks.





## Acknolowdgement
This repository is developed based on the [task-incremental learning respository](https://github.com/Mattdl/CLsurvey) of the [TPAMI survey paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9349197).
